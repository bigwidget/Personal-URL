				<h1>What I'm up to</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Running <b>MyType</b>, a psychology quiz app that gives you feedback about your personality, values and morals.  On the business side we're selling psychographic market research data (aggregate, not individuals), and we're flirting with the idea of transitioning into online dating.</li>
					<li>Occasional outreach in the NY/Boston tech industries on behalf of the <b>Department of Defense</b>, specifically looking for innovation related to cyber security.</li>
					<li>Building <b>Liberty Hive</b>, a simple side project to learn Ruby on Rails and test my ideas about giving interest-based communities a meaningful forum online.</li>
					<li>Getting acquainted with <b>New York</b>.  I just moved here in April 2011.</li>
				</ul>
				<h1>I really like..</h1>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Creativity</b>, the introduction of something new (original, ingenious) and valuable (impactful, beautiful) to the world.  So far my two major outlets have been <b>product design</b> for web apps and <b>composing music</b></li>
					<li><b>Keen perception</b></li>
					<li><b>Sincerity</b></li>
					<li>People who combine all three are particularly special: David Foster Wallace, Peter Thiel, Steve Jobs.  Btw, if both DFW and Thiel are on your short list of people you admire, we're friends.  Drop me a line.</li>
					<li><b>Gripping 50+ hour movies disguised as TV shows</b>: Battlestar Galactica, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Mad Men</li>
					<li><b>The mind</b>, for its unrivaled combination of centrality and mystery, as well as the implications of cracking the code.  Some favorite mind-related books: On Intelligence, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, Gut Feelings, Made to Stick, Happiness Hypothesis</li>
					<li><b>Intense, minor-key music</b>: The National, Arcade Fire, Arvo Part, Joanna Newsom, Antony and The Johnsons</li>
					<li><b>Writing that grazes the soul</b>: many essays by David Foster Wallace, Calvin Trillin's "Alice, Off The Page", The Road, The Unbearable Lightness of Being</li>
					<li><b>Sports</b>, particularly pickup basketball, snowboarding, paintball, and scuba diving</li>
					<li><b>Genius</b>: David Foster Wallace, Nabokov, Steve Jobs, Einstein</li>
					<li><b>Adventure</b>, very hard to find in adulthood but I have some crazy ideas</li>
					<li>And most important of all: <b>close relationships</b></li>
				</ul>
